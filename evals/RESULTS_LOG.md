# Results log (for future analysis)

A narrative companion to the machine-readable `runs.jsonl` / `LEADERBOARD.md`. Each entry records
**what we changed, why, and what the eval did** — the context a bare metrics row can't hold. Newest
first. The GPU/Colab QLoRA run (deferred) will append here too.

Metrics are the deterministic (non-AI) validator checks, base vs. tuned, on held-out scenarios:
`hard_pass` (all checks), `OOV` (out-of-vocabulary rate, lower better), `<=1-new` (≤1 new word per
sentence), `recurrence` (target repeated ≥3×). See `docs/EVALUATION.md`.

## Root-cause finding (2026-07-08): the prompt didn't fit the training window

**Symptom.** Through Day 2 and the first Day 3, tuned `hard_pass` never moved off 0.000; only OOV
drifted a little. Looked like "tiny model, too few steps." It wasn't.

**Actual cause — a data bug, not a compute one.** Each training record's prompt embedded the
**full 2291-word baseline** as `KNOWN_WORDS`, rendering records to **5k–12k tokens**. The assistant
story (the completion we train on) sits at the *end*. Training left-truncated to 256 tokens to keep
the story — but `TARGET_WORDS`, the theme, and the rules all sit *before* the giant word list, so
truncation **deleted the entire task description**. The model trained on
`"[tail of a word list] Write 8-14 sentences. [story]"` and never saw what it was supposed to do.
Meanwhile the eval prompt used only the 146-word curated list — so train and eval didn't even match.

**Fix (in data, per the Day-4 "fix in data not hyperparameters" principle).** `seed.py` now scopes
each record's `KNOWN_WORDS` to **the curated-small baseline (~146) ∪ the story's own content
words**, minus the target. Records dropped to **539–704 tokens (mean 610)** — the whole prompt now
fits a 768-token window uncut, and matches the eval's `--curated` setup.

| | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| KNOWN_WORDS per record | 2291 words | ~150 words |
| Record size | 5k–12k tokens | 539–704 tokens |
| Task text (TARGET_WORDS + rules) survives truncation? | **No** | **Yes** |
| Train/eval prompt match | No (2291 vs 146) | Yes (both ~146 curated) |

## Runs

<!-- newest first; append a block per run -->

### 2026-07-09 — `v6` (epochs 3 vs v5's 5) — NEGATIVE RESULT, v5 still best

**One variable changed** from v5: epochs 5→3 (r32/α64, lr2e-4, aligned recipe). Hypothesis: the
coherence/interestingness collapse is over-fitting, so less training should preserve prose quality.
Final train loss 1.27 (v5: 0.87). Judge = claude-sonnet-4-6.

Golden set, base→tuned (the canonical target):

| lang | OOV (v6) | OOV (v5) | hard (v6/v5) | coherence (v6/v5) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| en | 0.425→**0.127** | →0.133 | 0.051 / **0.103** | 0.23 / 0.15 |
| zh | 0.881→0.377 | →**0.250** | 0.125 / 0.000 | 0.00 / 0.00 |
| ja | 1.000→0.480 | →**0.117** | 0.000 / **0.250** | 0.00 / 0.00 |

**Verdict: v6 does NOT beat v5.** Fewer epochs nudged English coherence up (0.15→0.23) but
**regressed OOV badly on zh (0.25→0.38) and ja (0.12→0.48)** and lost ja's hard-passes. Held-out
was roughly comparable to v5, but golden — the correctness target — is clearly worse. Interpretation:
the quality collapse is a **model-capacity limit, not over-fitting**; epoch count isn't the lever.
This is why the overnight plan pivots to **scaling the dataset** (v7): a 135M model on 22 examples
is near its ceiling regardless of hyperparameters. v5 remains the best adapter.

### 2026-07-08 — `v5` (aligned QLoRA recipe; **judged**, all criteria, **on the golden set**)

First run scored on **all three criteria families** — deterministic checks, the 8-dimension
LLM-judge rubric (judge = `claude-sonnet-4-6`), and cloze inferability — and the first run
evaluated **on the golden set** (Layer 1), not just held-out. Base and tuned both judged on the
same inputs.

**Hyperparameters** (`outputs/day3_lora_v5/train_summary.json`): SmolLM2-135M-Instruct, LoRA
r=32/α=64, **5 epochs / 110 steps**, lr 2e-4, seq 768, **cosine schedule + 3% warmup** (aligned
QLoRA recipe), adamw_torch (CPU), final train loss **0.87**.

Deterministic + cloze, base→tuned:

| Target / lang | Hard-pass (→1) | OOV (→≤.02) | ≤1-new (→1) | Recurrence (→1) | Cloze infer. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| golden en | 0.000→**0.103** | 0.425→**0.133** | 0.000→**0.487** | 0.205→**0.385** | 0.179→0.000 |
| golden zh | 0.000→0.000 | 0.881→**0.250** | 0.000→0.125 | 0.000→**0.875** | 0.000→0.125 |
| golden ja | 0.000→**0.250** | 1.000→**0.117** | 0.000→**0.500** | 0.000→**0.625** | 0.000→0.125 |
| heldout en | 0.000→**0.125** | 0.413→**0.080** | 0.000→**0.500** | 0.125→**0.250** | 0.250→0.000 |
| heldout zh | 0.000→0.000 | 0.856→**0.245** | 0.000→0.125 | 0.125→**0.625** | 0.000→0.062 |
| heldout ja | 0.000→**0.125** | 1.000→**0.142** | 0.000→**0.375** | 0.000→**0.375** | 0.000→0.062 |
| exam en | 0.000→**0.125** | 0.430→**0.155** | 0.000→**0.500** | 0.000→0.125 | 0.000→0.000 |

Judge rubric (0–2), base→tuned, key dimensions:

| Target / lang | spec_adh | robustness | consistency | coherence | interestingness | overall |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| golden en | 0.00→**0.59** | 0.00→**0.51** | 0.10→**1.00** | 0.23→0.15 | 0.05→0.00 | 0.14→**0.45** |
| golden zh | — | — | — | 0.50→0.00 | 0.25→0.00 | 0.16→0.19 |
| golden ja | — | — | — | 0.88→0.00 | 0.12→0.00 | 0.19→0.05 |
| heldout en | 0.00→**0.5+** | up | up | 0.38→0.00 | 0.12→0.00 | 0.20→**0.31** |
| exam en | up | up | up | 0.25→**0.38** | 0.00→0.00 | 0.06→**0.33** |

**Read.** The deterministic + spec-judge story is strongly positive everywhere: OOV collapses
(ja 1.00→0.12, zh 0.88→0.25, en 0.43→0.13 on golden), and en/ja post hard-passes on both golden
and held-out. Judge spec_adherence/robustness/consistency all rise. **But every quality
dimension — coherence, interestingness, task_quality — drops, often to 0**, most starkly on
zh/ja golden (coherence 0.88→0.00 for ja). This is the real finding the new criteria surface: the
135M model buys vocabulary control by producing rigid, repetitive prose. Base-model judged scores
are near-zero across the board (the base ignores the word list *and* isn't compelling). Win
condition (spec_adherence AND robustness up): **PASS** on en. The quality regression is the
Colab-scale lever: a 4B model should hold the constraints without flattening the story.

**Iterations & hyperparameters** (from `outputs/day3_lora_v3/train_summary.json`):

| Setting | Value | | Setting | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Base model | `SmolLM2-135M-Instruct` | | LoRA rank `r` | **32** (v2: 16) |
| Method | LoRA (CPU) | | LoRA `alpha` | **64** (v2: 32) |
| **Epochs** | **5** (v2: 3) | | LoRA `dropout` | 0.05 |
| **Optimizer steps** | **110** (v2: 66) | | Learning rate | 2e-4 |
| Batch / grad-accum | 1 / 1 | | Max sequence length | 768 |
| Final train loss | **0.86** (v2: 1.63) | | Seed | 0 |

**Change from v2:** 5 epochs (was 3) and double the LoRA capacity (r=32/α=64 vs 16/32). Rationale:
on 22 examples the cheap levers are more passes + more adapter capacity to absorb the constrained
style.

| Lang | OOV (base→tuned) | Hard-pass (→1.000) | ≤1-new (→1.000) | Recurrence (→1.000) | vs v2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| en | 0.413 → **0.096** (−0.317) | 0.000 → **0.125** | 0.000 → **0.500** | 0.125 → 0.125 | better (v2 OOV 0.170, hard 0) |
| zh | 0.856 → **0.279** (−0.577) | 0.000 → 0.000 | 0.000 → 0.000 | 0.125 → **0.875** | mixed (better OOV/recur; lost v2's hard 0.25) |
| ja | 1.000 → **0.167** (−0.833) | 0.000 → **0.250** | 0.000 → **0.625** | 0.000 → **0.500** | far better (v2 OOV 0.874) |

**Read.** v3 beats v2 clearly: English and Japanese post their first hard-passes, OOV drops hard
across all three languages, and ≤1-new-word/recurrence move up substantially. The one regression is
zh hard-pass (0.25 → 0), even though zh OOV and recurrence improved — the tighter fit helped most
checks but pushed a couple of zh stories just over a gate. Net: the highest-leverage cheap knobs
(epochs + LoRA capacity) worked. Win condition still FAIL (OOV ≤ 0.02 gate needs the GPU run).

**Exam set** (`day3-v3-exam`, GRE/SAT/ACT targets, `heldout_exam_en`): OOV 0.430 → **0.169**,
≤1-new 0.000 → **0.500**, recurrence 0.000 → 0.125, hard-pass 0.000 → 0.000. The v3 adapter
generalizes to hard exam-vocabulary targets it never trained on — OOV more than halves — even
though no story clears every gate yet.

### 2026-07-08 — `exam-baseline` (GRE/SAT/ACT targets, prompted base model)

**What.** Base `SmolLM2-135M-Instruct` (prompted, no fine-tune) on 8 held-out English scenarios
whose to-learn targets are **GRE/SAT/ACT exam words** (`evals/scenarios/heldout_exam_en.jsonl`),
temperature 0, `--max-new-tokens 200`.

| Metric | Value | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hard-pass | 0.000 | 1.000 |
| OOV | 0.430 | ≤0.02 |
| ≤1-new | 0.000 | 1.000 |
| Recurrence | 0.000 | 1.000 |

**Read.** The base model fails exam-vocabulary scenarios about the same as CEFR ones (OOV 0.430 vs
0.413) — it ignores the allowed-word list either way. This is the **baseline to beat** once the
harder targets flow into training. It confirms the exam words load, sample as targets, and run
through the real harness end to end. Reproduce: `docs/EVALUATION.md` → "Per-word-list coverage".

### 2026-07-08 — `day3-seed-lora-v2` (the data fix lands)

**Iterations & hyperparameters** (from `outputs/day3_lora/train_summary.json`):

| Setting | Value | | Setting | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Base model | `SmolLM2-135M-Instruct` | | LoRA rank `r` | 16 |
| Method | LoRA (not QLoRA; CPU) | | LoRA `alpha` | 32 |
| Device | CPU | | LoRA `dropout` | 0.05 |
| Train examples | 22 | | `target_modules` | all-linear |
| **Epochs** | **3** | | Learning rate | 2e-4 |
| **Optimizer steps (iterations)** | **66** | | LR schedule | linear (TRL default) |
| Per-device batch size | 1 | | Optimizer | adamw_torch (TRL default) |
| Gradient accumulation | 1 | | Seed | 0 |
| Effective batch size | 1 | | Max sequence length | 768 (left-truncated) |
| Final train loss | **1.63** | | (was 2.33 when records were truncated) | |

Eval: 8 held-out `--curated` scenarios per language, temperature 0, `--max-new-tokens 220`.
Reproduce command is in `docs/DAY3.md` → Reproduce.

Targets in parentheses are the Behavior-Spec thresholds (`config.Thresholds`).

| Lang | OOV (→ ≤0.02) | Hard-pass (→ 1.000) | ≤1-new (→ 1.000) | Recurrence (→ 1.000) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| en | 0.413 → **0.170** (−0.243) | 0.000 → 0.000 | 0.000 → 0.000 | 0.125 → 0.125 |
| zh | 0.856 → **0.439** (−0.417) | 0.000 → **0.250** | 0.000 → **0.250** | 0.125 → **0.375** |
| ja | 1.000 → **0.874** (−0.126) | 0.000 → 0.000 | 0.000 → **0.125** | 0.000 → 0.000 |

**Read.** The eval improved on every language. OOV fell **12×** more than the old truncated run
(en −0.243 vs −0.020), and **zh produced the project's first non-zero hard-pass (0.25)** — direct
evidence the model now sees `TARGET_WORDS` + the rules during training. `hard_pass` stays low overall
because the gate is OOV ≤ 0.02, which a 135M model on CPU LoRA won't clear; that ceiling is a
model/compute limit, not the data bug we just fixed.

**Win condition:** still FAIL (spec bar unchanged) — expected pre-GPU.

**Next levers (need Colab GPU / teacher key, deferred):** (1) a teacher-generated corpus for volume
beyond the 28-story seed; (2) a real multi-epoch **QLoRA** run on a larger base (e.g. Qwen3-4B);
(3) ja is the laggard (OOV still 0.87) — more ja seed stories + a JLPT-scoped known list.
